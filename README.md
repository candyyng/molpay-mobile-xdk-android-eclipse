        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_amount, "1.10"); 
        
        // Mandatory String. Values obtained from MOLPay

        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_password, "password");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_merchant_ID, "merchantid");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_app_name, "appname");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_verification_key, "vkey123");
    
        // Mandatory String. Payment values
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_order_ID, "orderid123");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_currency, "MYR");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_country, "MY");
        
        // Optional String.
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_channel, "multi"); // Use 'multi' for all available channels option. For individual channel seletion, please refer to "Channel Parameter" in "Channel Lists" in the MOLPay API Spec for Merchant pdf.

        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_bill_mobile, "+1234567");
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_channel_editing, false); // Option to allow channel selection.

        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_transaction_id, ""); // Optional, provide a valid cash channel transaction id here will display a payment instruction screen.
        paymentDetails.put(MOLPayActivity.mp_request_type, "");

## Start the payment module

    startActivityForResult(intent, MOLPayActivity.MOLPayXDK);

## Cash channel payment process (How does it work?)

    This is how the cash channels work on XDK:
    
    1) The user initiate a cash payment, upon completed, the XDK will pause at the “Payment instruction” screen, the results would return a pending status.
    
    2) The user can then click on “Close” to exit the MOLPay XDK aka the payment screen.
    
    3) When later in time, the user would arrive at say 7-Eleven to make the payment, the host app then can call the XDK again to display the “Payment Instruction” again, then it has to pass in all the payment details like it will for the standard payment process, only this time, the host app will have to also pass in an extra value in the payment details, it’s the “mp_transaction_id”, the value has to be the same transaction returned in the results from the XDK earlier during the completion of the transaction. If the transaction id provided is accurate, the XDK will instead show the “Payment Instruction" in place of the standard payment screen.
    
    4) After the user done the paying at the 7-Eleven counter, they can close and exit MOLPay XDK by clicking the “Close” button again.
